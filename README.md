This is both a web scraper and MVP projection model
The Scraper is written in Python and forces a requests instance to take certain headers in order to not be rejected

You can easily plug in your own endpoint (and modify URL parameters) and everything should work

I have included an already scraped spreadsheet of sample data which I used for my project.
