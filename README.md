This is a web scraper for the NBA Stats API
The Scraper is written in Python and forces a requests object to take certain headers in order to not be rejected
Data is then converted into a dataframe using Pandas and then a spreadsheet
(The spreadsheet is not nessecary!)

You can easily plug in your own endpoint (and modify URL parameters) and everything should work
